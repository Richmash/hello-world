First program on freecode

Hello fellow Man, or Wo-Man...

I am interested in programming and learning new things in general. late starter, hey, its never too late.
Hope that when i look back at this commit, I am light years away from here and deep into code territory surrounded by beings of this new found planet, having learnt enough of their language and culture to converse with their masters! 
Yes!!
